Overview understanding of cloud computing :
1. The user can store or access data in internet rather than local computer or server.
2. One can pay only for the services that is needed, and only as long as one needs.(Pay-as-you-go model)

3. There are 3 types of "service" models:
  A. Infrastructure as a service (Iaas): It is virtual computing resource. Eg. MS Azure
  B. Platform as a service (Paas): Hardware & Software tools over internet for application development. Eg. MS Azure Paas 
  C. Software as a service (Saas): Using software applications over internet based on subscription. Eg. MS 365

4. There are 3 types of "deployment" models:
  A. Public cloud: Here the services are publically available & can be shared across organisations
  B. Private cloud: Here the service is give to a single organisation. It gives more privacy & security of information.
  C. Hybrid cloud: It is combination of public and private clouds.

5. Use cases:
